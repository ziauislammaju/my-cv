            <h6 id="h"><strong><em>I've been interested in technology (mainly computers and other electronics) and programming for quite a while now. And although I enjoy programming as a hobby very much, I have some doubts of going into programming / software development as a career. Instead I'm aiming towards other computer careers like consulting or computer security. I also have my eyes (partially) set in finance and economics, although I don't know if I'll do as well in that career track because I'm more of a tech-y person. Now let me explain - I find programming as a hobby very interesting. I enjoy the problem solving that lies underneath it and I enjoy creating applications (especially Web applications) very time. However, the thing is, I don't enjoy working on large-scale projects. I have created one before and finished it, but once I get to a certain point, it just feels like all of the code is very unorganized and requires a complete rewrite. Also I don't like being told what projects to work on, instead I like to pick my own. And finally, I figured out that I program best when under little pressure and stress. I don't want to have deadlines to complete when working on a programming project, instead I enjoy the freedom and independence of being able to develop and work on my projects anytime I like. ^ That's why I want to program as a hobby, but not choose it for a career. What are your viewpoints on this? Do you hold the same opinions as me or do you prefer vice versa? </em></strong></h6>
